# GetPlaylists
Get my Spotify playlists

A Python 3 script, modified from https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/blob/master/examples/user_playlists_contents.py

To get a token, register your app here: https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/

...or just go to the Spotify Web API console (https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/), generate a temporary token, and use that.
